# Big-O-notation
## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive guide to understanding and analyzing algorithms using **Big O notation**.  
Big O notation is a mathematical representation used to describe the **limiting behavior** of an algorithm as the input size increases.  
It helps classify algorithms based on how their **runtime or space requirements** grow as the input grows.


## What is Big O Notation?
Big O notation, written as `O(f(n))`, expresses the **upper bound** of an algorithm’s time or space complexity in the **worst-case scenario**.  
It provides a standardized way to understand how efficiently an algorithm scales with larger input data.

### Key Characteristics:
- **Growth Rate:** How runtime increases as input size increases  
- **Worst Case:** Focuses on maximum time or space needed  
- **Asymptotic Behavior:** Describes performance as input approaches infinity  
- **Scalability:** Indicates how well an algorithm performs on large datasets  


## Common Big O Complexities

### 1. O(1) – Constant Time
**Performance:** Excellent  
**Definition:** Execution time remains constant regardless of input size  
**Examples:** Accessing an array element by index, hash table lookup, stack operations  
**Graph Behavior:** Flat horizontal line  


### 2. O(log n) – Logarithmic Time
**Performance:** Excellent  
**Definition:** Runtime increases logarithmically with input size  
**Examples:** Binary search, balanced tree operations, divide and conquer algorithms  
**Graph Behavior:** Slowly increasing curve that flattens out  


### 3. O(n) – Linear Time
**Performance:** Good  
**Definition:** Runtime grows directly proportional to input size  
**Examples:** Linear search, finding min/max in an array, single loop traversal  
**Graph Behavior:** Straight diagonal line  


### 4. O(n log n) – Linearithmic Time
**Performance:** Fair  
**Definition:** Combination of linear and logarithmic growth  
**Examples:** Merge Sort, Quick Sort (average case), Heap Sort  
**Graph Behavior:** Slightly curved upward from linear growth  


### 5. O(n²) – Quadratic Time
**Performance:** Poor  
**Definition:** Runtime grows quadratically with input size  
**Examples:** Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, nested loops  
**Graph Behavior:** Steep upward curve  

### 6. O(n³) – Cubic Time
**Performance:** Very Poor  
**Definition:** Runtime grows cubically with input size  
**Examples:** Matrix multiplication, triple nested loops  
**Graph Behavior:** Very steep upward curve  


### 7. O(2ⁿ) – Exponential Time
**Performance:** Terrible  
**Definition:** Runtime doubles with each additional input element  
**Examples:** Recursive Fibonacci, subset generation, brute force combinatorics  
**Graph Behavior:** Exponentially steep curve  



### 8. O(n!) – Factorial Time
**Performance:** Catastrophic  
**Definition:** Runtime grows factorially with input size  
**Examples:** Permutation generation, Traveling Salesman brute force  
**Graph Behavior:** Fastest possible growth

# Conclusion
Big O notation is a critical tool for understanding algorithm efficiency.  
It helps developers choose the **most optimal solution** for large-scale problems by comparing growth rates rather than exact runtimes.
